<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">You can specify properties to apply to the current flow.</p>

<p>To set flow properties, click the <span class="ph uicontrol">Flow Properties</span> icon <img src="images/flow_properties.png" width="20" alt="">.</p>

<p>You can configure the following properties.</p>

<section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="flow_properties__title__2"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="flow_properties__title__2">Options</h2>

<dl>

<dt class="dlterm">General</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">
<dl>

<dt class="dlterm">Maximum number of rows to show in Data Preview</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">When you preview the data for a node, you can specify the number of rows to show.</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">Limit members for nominal fields</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">The data type of the nominal (set) fields becomes <span class="ph uicontrol">Typeless</span> when the
number of members exceeds the maximum number of members that you set in <span class="ph uicontrol">Maximum
members</span>. This option is useful when you are working with large nominal fields. When the
measurement level of a field is set to <span class="ph uicontrol">Typeless</span>, its role is automatically
set to <span class="ph uicontrol">None</span>. Fields that are set to <span class="ph uicontrol">None</span> aren't
available for modeling.</dd>


</dl>

</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">Date/Time</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">
<dl>

<dt class="dlterm">Import date/time/timestamp as</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Select whether to use a date and time format for storing data in date and time fields or whether
to import them as string variables.</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">Use microseconds in timestamp fields</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">If you have timestamp data that is measured in microseconds, you can enable this option to use
the more precise data in your flows. To enable the option, select this checkbox and
<span class="ph uicontrol">String</span> for the <span class="ph uicontrol">Import date/time/timestamp as</span>
setting.<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> This option works only for connectors that support SQL pushback.
</div>
</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">Date format</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Select a date format to use for date storage fields or when strings are interpreted as dates by
CLEM date functions.</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">Time format</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Select a time format to use for time storage fields or when strings are interpreted as times by
CLEM time functions.</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">Rollover days/mins</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">For time formats, select whether negative time differences are interpreted as referring to the
previous day or hour.</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">Date baseline (1st Jan)</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Select the baseline years (always 1 January) to be used by CLEM date functions that work with a
single date.</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">2-digit dates start from</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Specify the cutoff year to add century digits for years that are denoted with only 2 digits. For
example, specifying 1930 as the cutoff year assumes that 05/11/02 is in the year 2002. The same
setting will use the 20th century for dates after 30; thus 05/11/73 is assumed to be in 1973.</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">Time zone</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Select how the time zone is chosen for use with the <code class="ph codeph">datetime_now</code> CLEM
expression.<ul>
<li>If you select <span class="ph uicontrol">Server</span>, the time
zone is used from where the SPSS Modeler run-time is running
(sometimes this time is the same as the <span class="ph uicontrol">Client</span> option). Or if your flow uses
data from a database and the supported database uses SQL pushback, the <code class="ph codeph">datetime_now</code>
expression uses the time of the database. </li>


<li>If you select <span class="ph uicontrol">Client</span>, the time zone is used from the machine where SPSS
Modeler is installed.</li>

<li>Alternatively, you can select any of the Coordinated Universal Time values for the time
zone.</li>

</ul>
</dd>


</dl>

</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">Number Formats</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">You can specify the number of decimal places to use when <span class="keyword">SPSS Modeler</span> displays real numbers in standard, scientific, or currency display formats.</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">Optimization</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">You can use these settings to optimize flow performance. <dl>

<dt class="dlterm">Enable flow rewriting</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Flow rewriting reorders the nodes in a flow behind the scenes for more efficient operation,
without altering flow semantics.</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">Optimize CLEM expressions</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">This option enables the optimizer to search for CLEM expressions that can be preprocessed before
the flow runs to increase the processing speed. For example, if you have an expression such as
<code class="ph codeph">log(salary)</code>, the optimizer calculates the actual salary value and passes that on
for processing. This option can be used to improve both SQL pushback and <span class="keyword">SPSS Modeler</span> performance.</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">Optimize syntax execution</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">This method of flow rewriting increases the efficiency of operations that have more than one
node that contains SPSS Statistics syntax. Optimization is achieved by combining the syntax commands
into a single operation, instead of running each as a separate operation.</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">Optimize other execution</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">This method of flow rewriting increases the efficiency of operations that can't be delegated to
the database. Optimization is achieved by reducing the amount of data in the flow as early as
possible. The flow is rewritten to push operations closer to the data source while maintaining data
integrity. This change reduces data downstream for costly operations, such as joins.</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">Enable parallel processing</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">When running on a computer with multiple processors, this option allows the system to balance
the load across those processors, which can result in faster performance. Use of multiple nodes or
use of the following individual nodes can benefit from parallel processing: C5.0, Merge (by key),
Sort, Bin (rank and tile methods), and Aggregate (using one or more key fields).</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">Generate SQL</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">
<ul>
<li>This option pushes SQL processing back to the database. Turning this option on or off affects
only the new flows that you create. You cannot switch the setting for an existing flow. For more
information about using this option with flows, see <a href="sql_overview.html#sql_overview__note_OptimizationTips">SQL optimization</a>.<ul>
<li><span class="ph uicontrol">Database caching (SQL only)</span>. For flows that generate SQL to be run in the
database, data can be cached mid flow to a temporary table in the database rather than to the file
system. When combined with SQL optimization, this option can result in significant gains in
performance. For example, the output from a flow that merges multiple tables to create a data mining
view may be cached and reused as needed. With database caching enabled, hover over any nonterminal
node in your flow, then click the overflow menu <img src="images/actions.png" alt=""> and
select <span class="ph menucascade"><span class="ph uicontrol">Cache</span><abbr title="and then"> &gt; </abbr><span class="ph uicontrol">Enable</span></span>. Data is
now cached at this node, and the cache is automatically created directly in the database the next
time the flow runs. This allows SQL to be generated for downstream nodes, further improving
performance. Alternatively, this option can be disabled if needed, such as when policies or
permissions preclude data being written to the database. If database caching or SQL optimization is
not enabled, the cache is written to the file system instead.</li>

<li><span class="ph uicontrol">Use relaxed conversion (SQL only)</span>. This option enables the conversion of
data from either strings to numbers, or numbers to strings, if stored in a suitable format. For
example, if the data is kept in the database as a string, but actually contains a meaningful number,
the data can be converted for use when the pushback occurs.</li>

<dt class="dlterm">Logging</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">
<dl>

<dt class="dlterm">Display SQL in the messages log at run time</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Specifies whether SQL generated while running the flow is passed to the messages log.</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">Display SQL generation in the message log during preparation</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">During flow preview, specifies whether a preview of the SQL that would be generated is passed to
the messages log.</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">SQL format</dt>

standard ODBC functions of the form <code class="ph codeph">{fn FUNC(â¦)}</code>, as generated by <span class="keyword">SPSS Modeler</span>. The former relies on ODBC driver functionality that may not be
implemented.</dd>

<section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="flow_properties__title__3"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="flow_properties__title__3">Parameters</h2><span class="ph">Parameters are user-defined variables that are saved and
   persisted with the current flow or SuperNode. Parameters are often used in scripting to control
   the behavior of the script, and they can be accessed from the user interface as
  well.</span><p><span class="ph">You can define parameters for use in CLEM expressions and in
    scripting. Parameters that are defined in the flow properties are available to all nodes in the
    flow.</span>
<span class="ph">Parameters set for a SuperNode are
     not available outside of the SuperNode.</span>
<span class="ph">If you save a flow, any parameters set for that flow are also
    saved.</span></p>
<p>For more information about
parameters, see <a href="parameters.html">Flow and SuperNode
parameters</a>.</p>
<p>Click
<span class="ph uicontrol">Add value</span> and enter the following information for the new parameter: </p>
<dl>

<dt class="dlterm">Name</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">This name is how the parameter is referenced in expressions. For example, to create a parameter
for a minimum temperature, you could enter <kbd class="ph userinput">minvalue</kbd>. <p>When parameters are
used in CLEM expressions, they are placed within single quotation marks, for example,
<code class="ph codeph">'$P-minvalue'</code>. Do not enter the <code class="ph codeph">$P-</code> prefix. It denotes a parameter
in CLEM expressions. </p>
</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">Label</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Lists a descriptive name for each parameter created.</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">Storage</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Storage indicates how the data values are stored in the parameter. For example, if values have
leading zeros that you want to preserve (such as <code class="ph codeph">008</code>), select
<span class="ph uicontrol">String</span> as the storage type. Otherwise, the zeros are stripped from the
value.</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">Value</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Lists the current value for each parameter, which you can change as needed. Values for date
parameters must be specified in ISO standard notation (YYYY-MM-DD).</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">Measure</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Select the measurement level, which is used to describe characteristics of the parameter. You
can change this value to reflect the way that you intend to use the parameter. For example,
<span class="ph uicontrol">Typeless</span> indicates that the parameter can have any value compatible with its
storage.</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">Prompt?</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Select this option if you want users to be prompted to enter a value for this parameter when
they start the runtime. You can use this option where you might need to enter different values for
the same parameter on different
occasions.</dd>


</dl>
</section>

<section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="flow_properties__title__4"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="flow_properties__title__4">Globals</h2>

<p>In the <span class="ph uicontrol">Globals</span> tab of the flow properties, you can view the global values
set for the current flow. Global values are created using a <span class="ph uicontrol">Set Globals</span> node
to determine statistics such as mean, sum, or standard deviation for selected fields.</p>

<p>After a <span class="ph uicontrol">Set Globals</span> node runs, these values become available for various
uses in flow operations.</p>

<p>You can't edit global values in the table here in the flow properties, but you can clear all
global values for a flow.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="flow_properties__title__5"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="flow_properties__title__5">Annotations</h2>

<p>If you need to describe a flow to others in your organization, you can attach explanatory
comments to flows, nodes, and model nuggets. Others can then view these comments on-screen or even
print an image of the flow that includes your comments.</p>

<p>Use the <span class="ph uicontrol">Annotations</span> tab of the flow properties to add text annotations to
your flow. These notes are visible only when the <span class="ph uicontrol">Annotations</span> tab is open,
except that flow annotations can also be shown as on-screen comments.</p>
