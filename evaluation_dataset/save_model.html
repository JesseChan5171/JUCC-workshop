<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">You can promote <span class="keyword">SPSS Modeler</span> flows and models to <span class="keyword" data-hd-audience="cloud wx" translate="no">watsonx.ai Runtime</span> if you have the <span class="keyword" data-hd-audience="cloud wx" translate="no">watsonx.ai Runtime</span> service.</p>

<p>After you build a model, you need to publish it or the flow that it is in so that others can
access the model. Users, developers, or systems can access the model in the deployment space and use
it to analyze data or make predictions.</p>

<p>In <span class="keyword" data-hd-audience="cloud wx" translate="no">watsonx.ai Runtime</span>, you add your flows and models to
a deployment space, where you can test and manage them. In a deployment space, you can prepare your
flows and models for use in pre-production or production environments to generate predictions and
insights. </p>

<p>Deploying models and flows has these benefits. </p>

<dt class="dlterm">Real-time Insights</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Deployed models can provide real-time predictions or insights. Real-time data enables faster
decision-making and more efficient operations.</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">Scalability</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Deployed models can scale to handle increasing amounts of data and demand so that they maintain
their performance as your business grows.</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">Integration</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Deployed models can be integrated with other systems and applications. For example, you can use
API end points to enable integration.</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">Security</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Deployed models can be secured by using access controls, encryption, and other best practices.
Security measures ensure that sensitive data remains protected.</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">Maintainability</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Deployed models can be updated and maintained. You can update models as needed so that they
remain accurate and relevant over time.</dd>

<p>Models can be saved as either a scoring branch or as predictive model markup language (PMML).
PMML is an XML format for describing data mining and statistical models. It includes inputs to the
models, transformations that are used to prepare data for data mining, and the parameters that
define the models themselves. If you save models as PMML, it is possible to share models with other
applications that support this format. For more information about PMML, see the <a href="http://www.dmg.org" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">Data Mining Group website</a>.</p>

<p>Models can be deployed in either online or batch deployments. For more information about
deployments, see <a href="../wsj/analyze-data/deploy-online.html">Creating online deployments</a> and <a href="../wsj/analyze-data/deploy-batch-details.html">Creating batch deployments</a>.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="save_model__title__3"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="save_model__title__3">Flows in deployment spaces</h2>

<p>Flows can be deployed only in batch deployments. For flows in a deployment space, you can decide
which terminal nodes to run in the flow each time that you create a batch job from the flow. You can
use this flexibility to run the whole flow or only a few nodes from it. You do not need to deploy
the flow in the deployment space to create batch jobs. </p>

<p>For more information about creating batch jobs for flows in deployment spaces, see <a href="../wsj/analyze-data/create-jobs-spss-flows.html">Creating jobs in
deployment spaces for <span class="keyword">SPSS Modeler</span> flows</a>.</p>

<p>You can promote any model or flow to a deployment space if it is saved as a project asset.</p>

<ol>
<li>If you want to promote a model, you need to save it to the project before you can promote it:<ol type="a">
<li>In your <span class="keyword">SPSS Modeler</span> flow, click the <span class="ph uicontrol">Save
Model</span> icon on the toolbar.</li>

<li>In <span class="ph uicontrol">Branch terminal node</span>, select the node that you want to make into a
model.</li>

<li>Enter a name and click <span class="ph uicontrol">Save</span> to save the model to as a project asset.</li>

</ol>
</li>

<li>Promote the flow or model:<ol type="a">
<li>Click the <span class="ph uicontrol">Assets</span> tab and find the model or flow. Click the overflow menu
<img src="images/actions.png" alt=""> and select <span class="ph uicontrol">Promote to
space</span>.</li>

<li>In <span class="ph uicontrol">Target space</span>, select the deployment space. Click
<span class="ph uicontrol">Promote</span>.</li>

</ol>
</li>

<li>If the flow or model needs any data assets or connections to run in the deployment space,
promote them from the <span class="ph uicontrol">Assets</span> tab as well. </li>

</ol>

<p>In the deployment space, you can then create deployments and jobs to generate predictions for new
data. For more information, see <a href="../wsj/analyze-data/ml-overview_local.html">Deploying AI assets</a>.</p>

<p>For a list of which data sources are supported for models in <span class="keyword" data-hd-audience="cloud wx" translate="no">watsonx.ai Runtime</span>, refer to the
<span class="ph uicontrol">SPSS</span> section under <a href="../wsj/analyze-data/deploy-batch-input-spss.html">Batch deployment input details for <span class="keyword">SPSS Modeler</span> models</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to deploy several models and flows to a deployment space, you can export the project
that they are in and then import the project in the deployment space. For more information about
exporting and importing projects, see <a href="../wsj/manage-data/export-project.html">Exporting project assets</a> and <a href="../wsj/analyze-data/ml-space-import-to-space.html">Importing space
