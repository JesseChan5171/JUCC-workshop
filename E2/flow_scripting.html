<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">You can use scripts to customize operations within a particular flow, and they're saved
  with that flow. For example, you might use a script to specify a particular run order for terminal
  nodes. You use the flow properties page to edit the script that is saved with the current flow. </p>

<p>To access scripting in a flow's properties, click <span class="ph uicontrol">Scripting</span> in the
   toolbar.</p>

<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Tips:</span> 
<ul>
<li>By default, the Python scripting language is used. If you want to use a scripting language
     unique to old versions of <span class="keyword">SPSS Modeler</span> desktop, select
      <span class="ph uicontrol">Legacy</span>.</li>

<li>For more information about scripting, see the <a href="nodes/scripting_guide/clementine/scripting_overview.html">Scripting and
      automation</a> guide. </li>

</ul>

</div>

<p>You can specify whether the script runs when the flow runs. To run the script each time the flow
   runs, respecting the run order of the script, select <span class="ph uicontrol">Run the script</span>. This
   setting provides automation at the flow level for quicker model building. Or, to ignore the
   script, you can select <span class="ph uicontrol">Run all terminal nodes</span> when the flow runs.</p>

<p>The script editor includes the following features that help with script authoring:</p>

<ul>
<li>Syntax highlighting that highlights keywords, literal values (such as strings and numbers), and
    comments</li>

<li>Line numbering</li>

<li>Block matching that highlights the corresponding end block when you place your cursor near the
    start of a program block</li>

<li>Suggested auto-completion</li>

</ul>

<p>A list of suggested syntax completions can be accessed by selecting
    <span class="ph uicontrol">Auto-Suggest</span> from the menu, or pressing Ctrl + Space. Use the cursor keys
   to move up and down the list, then press Enter to insert the selected text. To exit from
   auto-suggest mode without modifying the existing text, press Esc.</p>

        <section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="flow_scripting__title__2"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="flow_scripting__title__2">Messages</h2>
            
            <p>Messages contain updates about system information that are generated as <span class="keyword">SPSS Modeler</span> runs. You can view messages about flow
                operations, such as running, optimization, scripts, and time elapsed for model
                building and evaluation. Error messages are also reported here.</p>

You can use a flow to train a model when it runs. Normally, to test the model, you might run the modeling node to add the model to the flow, make the appropriate connections, and run an Analysis node. </li>
