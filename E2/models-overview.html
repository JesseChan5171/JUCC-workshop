            <p>A flow is a series of nodes that you connect on the canvas.</p>

                    <dt class="dlterm">Flow</dt>

                    <dd class="dlentry">A flow is a group of data-processing operations that are connected in
                        sequences. Flows represent the flow of data through each operation. Data
                        flows from the data source through the sequence of operations to the end.
                        Usually, a flow ends in a model or type of data output, such as a table or
                            chart.<p>Flows are created by adding nodes on to the canvas and
                            connecting them.</p>

                    <dd class="dlentry">A node is a modular, self-contained set of operations. Nodes are a graphical
                        way of representing these operations, and each node has a unique icon. These
                        nodes can be linked together on the canvas in a flow for more complex data
                        processing. </dd>

                
            </dl>

            <p>You can add modeling nodes to your flow. Each of the modeling nodes is a different
                modeling technique. You can add several modeling nodes to your flow to try
                different modeling techniques with your data. After you finish setting up your
                flow, you can run it so that your data is processed and the analyzed by the
                modeling nodes.</p>

        <section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="modelss-overview__title_qqb_jdn_zcb__title__1" id="modelss-overview__title_qqb_jdn_zcb"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="modelss-overview__title_qqb_jdn_zcb__title__1">The modeling process</h2>
            
            <p>The ability to predict an outcome is the central goal of predictive analytics, and
                understanding the modeling process is the key to using <span class="keyword">SPSS Modeler</span>.</p>

            <p>A model is a set of rules, formulas, or equations that can be used to predict an
                outcome based on a set of input fields or variables from your data.  For example, a
                financial institution might use a model to predict whether loan applicants are
                likely to be good or bad risks, based on information that is already known about
                past applicants. A tuned model is one of the objectives of working in <span class="keyword">SPSS Modeler</span>.</p>

            <p>Modeling is conducted in multiple iterations. Typically, you might run several
                modeling nodes that use the default parameters. You can then fine-tune the
                parameters for the modeling node, or you might return to the data preparation phase
                to adjust the data for the modeling node.</p>

            <p><span class="keyword">SPSS Modeler</span> offers various modeling methods that are
                taken from machine learning, artificial intelligence, and statistics. You can use
                the methods available on the node palette to derive new information from your data
                and to develop predictive models. Each method has certain strengths and is best
                suited for particular types of problems.</p>

            <p>If you get promising results from one of these modeling nodes, then you can save the
                modeling node as a model. This model can then be promoted and deployed for use in
                real-time predictive analysis.</p>

        <section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="modelss-overview__title__4"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="modelss-overview__title__4">Nodes palette</h2>
            
            <p>The nodes palette has all the nodes that are available in <span class="keyword">SPSS Modeler</span>. They are organized into groups based on their
                function. You can add any node in the nodes palette to your flow.</p>

            <p>For more information about the nodes palette, see <a href="nodes/_nodes.html" title="The following sections describe all the nodes available on the palette in SPSS Modeler. Drag-and-drop or double-click a node in the list to add it to your flow canvas. You can then double-click any node icon in your flow to set its properties.

        <section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="modelss-overview__title__5"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="modelss-overview__title__5">SuperNodes</h2>
            
            <p>You can save all or part of your flow as a SuperNode. This SuperNode can then be used
                just like a node in other flows. You can use a SuperNode to add complex layers of
                processing to a flow without adding a long sequence of nodes that can clutter your
                canvas.</p>

            <p>For more information about SuperNodes, see <a href="nodes/supernodes.html" title="One of the reasons the SPSS Modeler visual interface is so easy to learn is that each node has a clearly defined function. However, for complex processing, a long sequence of nodes may be necessary. Eventually, this may clutter your flow canvas and make it difficult to follow flow diagrams.">SuperNodes</a>.</p>
