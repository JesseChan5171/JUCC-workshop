    "question": "Which two methods can you use to visualize data in SPSS Modeler: one inside a flow using a specific node, and another via an external service mentioned in the documentation?",
    "correct_answer": "Use a Charts node to open the chart builder within a flow, and use the Data Refinery service to visualize your data externally.",

    "question": "What file extension is used for SPSS Modeler streams and which flow property option enables behind-the-scenes node reordering for performance optimization?",
    "correct_answer": "Streams use the `.str` file extension, and the “Enable flow rewriting” option automatically reorders nodes for optimization.",

  {
    "question": "In the flow scripting example, what method is used to link a model apply node to an analysis node, and where do you specify that the script runs when the flow runs?",
    "correct_answer": "The method `stream.linkBetween(appliernode, typenode, analysisnode)` links the nodes, and you select “Run the script” in the Scripting tab of the flow properties to have it execute each time the flow runs.",

    "question": "What methodology does SPSS Modeler follow and which feature do you use to visualize data with histograms, box plots, bar charts, and pie charts within a flow?",
    "correct_answer": "SPSS Modeler follows the CRISP-DM methodology, and you use the Chart builder feature to visualize data with histograms, box plots, bar charts, and pie charts within a flow.",

    "question": "How do you define parameters in SPSS Modeler flows and how can you access the flow scripting editor to customize operations within a flow?",
    "correct_answer": "You define parameters by opening Flow properties and clicking Add value to set parameters available to all nodes; you access the scripting editor by clicking Scripting in the flow’s toolbar.",

  {
    "question": "What is a flow and what is a node in SPSS Modeler?",
    "correct_answer": "A flow is a sequence of data-processing operations representing the path of your data; a node is a modular, self-contained operation represented graphically by a unique icon.",

  {
    "question": "How do you define parameters for flows and what distinguishes flow parameters from local script variables?",
    "correct_answer": "You define parameters in Flow properties or in a flow script; flow parameters are saved with the flow and available to all nodes, whereas local script variables exist only within the script in which they’re declared.",
