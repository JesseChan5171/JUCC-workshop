            <p>After you build your flow, you can use it to explore your data and run models. The
                following tasks are just a few of the things that you can do with your new flow</p>

            
            <ul>
                <li>If you want to preview the data in the flow, hover over a node. Click the
                    overflow menu <img src="images/actions.png" alt="">, and then select
                        <span class="ph uicontrol">Preview Data</span>. <p>If you want to examine your data
                        more thoroughly, use a <span class="ph uicontrol">Charts</span> node to open the chart
                        builder. In the chart builder, you can use advanced visualizations to
                        explore your data.</p>
</li>

                <li>If you want to group related nodes together into a Super Node, Ctrl-click the
                    nodes that you want. Hover over a node and select <span class="ph uicontrol">Create
                        SuperNode</span>.<p>A SuperNode turns a group of nodes into a reusable
                        node that you can more reuse easily across your flow.</p>

                        a flow finishes running, a new model nugget is generated. You can hover over
                        the model nugget, click the overflow menu <img src="images/actions.png" alt="">, and then select <span class="ph uicontrol">View Model</span> to
                        explore the output.</p>
</li>

                <li>If you want to run only a terminal node and not the entire flow. Click a node
                    and then click <span class="ph uicontrol">Run selected</span>.</li>

                <li>If you want to view the results of an Outputs node (such as a
                        <span class="ph uicontrol">Table</span> node), click the <span class="ph uicontrol">Outputs and
                        models</span> icon after the flow runs. <p>In the side panel, on the
                            <span class="ph uicontrol">Outputs</span> tab, click the object, such as a table,
                        to open it.</p>
</li>

                <li>If you want to save a version of a flow, click the <span class="ph uicontrol">View
                        versions</span> icon. In the side panel, click <span class="ph uicontrol">New
